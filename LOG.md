## 2026-10-19 Chunk 1: frozen environment

Run in a cloud Ubuntu 24.04.5 container (Python 3.13.16, root, kernel
6.18.44 without loadable modules) because the laptop Claude Code session had
no credits. Laptop facts relayed from a later Remote Control session: Ubuntu
26.04.1, kernel 7.0.0-38, Python 3.14.4 (python3.11 also present), 8 cores,
14 GB RAM, openvswitch kernel module available, apt has mininet 2.3.0,
openvswitch-switch 3.7.1, iperf3 3.20, tshark 4.6.6, python3-os-ken 4.1.1.

### Decision: os-ken 4.2.2 in a venv, with our own launcher

Options considered:
1. Ryu 4.34 in a Python 3.9 venv with eventlet 0.30.2. Rejected: the laptop has
   no 3.9, pyenv adds a toolchain build, Ryu is unmaintained since 2020, and
   docs/research_gap.md cites reports that the eventlet pin does not fix 3.10+.
2. Distro `python3-os-ken` 4.1.1. Rejected: ties us to the system Python,
   cannot be pinned in requirements.txt, and also has no manager CLI.
3. `pip install os-ken==4.2.2` (Aug 2026, classifiers 3.10-3.13). Chosen.

Finding while testing: os-ken 4.0.0 and later ship no `osken-manager` console
script and no `os_ken.cmd` package (checked the wheels for 3.1.1, 4.0.0, 4.1.2,
4.2.2; only 3.1.1 has them). The library part (app_manager, controller,
ofproto, packet) is unchanged. So `controllers/run.py` reimplements the ~30
lines of the CLI (hub.patch, cfg.CONF, AppManager.load_apps / create_contexts /
instantiate_apps, hub.joinall). It accepts the usual flags.

Both stacks were exercised with `scripts/fake_switch.py` (handshake, table-miss
flow, flood, learn, unicast flow): PASS with os-ken 4.2.2 + run.py and with
os-ken 3.1.1 + osken-manager, both on Python 3.13.16.

### Mininet in the container

- `apt install mininet openvswitch-switch iperf3 iperf ethtool iputils-ping
  telnet` worked. `ovs-ctl start` works without the kernel module; Mininet
  switches must then use `OVSSwitch(datapath='user')`. The kernel-datapath run
  hangs at bridge creation ("failed to create datapath ovs-system").
- First pingall showed 100 % loss: `ping` was not installed in the container.
  Not a networking fault. Added iputils-ping to setup.sh.
- Mininet's built-in `--test iperf` hung: it waits for `telnet` to confirm the
  server is listening. Added telnet to setup.sh; our smoke test uses iperf3
  with its own retry loop instead.
- TCP did not connect at all although ICMP did: flows showed h1->h2 SYNs
  forwarded (12 packets) and nothing back from h2. Cause: tx checksum offload
  on the host veth with the userspace datapath. `ethtool -K <intf> tx off rx
  off tso off gso off gro off` on every host and switch port fixed it. We wanted
  offloads off anyway for captures (CLAUDE.md pitfalls), so smoke.py now does
  it for all ports at start; later topologies should reuse `disable_offloads`.
- Available qdiscs here: htb, tbf, pfifo. Missing: netem, fq_codel. So TCLink
  bandwidth works in the container, delay does not. Chunk 2 cannot run here.

### Finish line

`sudo ./scripts/verify.sh` (controller from the venv, smoke topology, pingall,
10 s idle iperf3 on 10 Mbps TCLinks), cloud container, userspace datapath:
pingall 0 % loss, iperf3 9.53 Mbps = 95.3 % of 10 Mbps. Row in
results/verify/vm.csv, logs beside it, env snapshot in results/env/. An earlier
manual run of the same script gave 9.42 Mbps (94.2 %). Pass threshold in the
script is 90 % so a slower laptop does not fail on noise; the number is always
printed and logged.

The laptop run (kernel datapath, real sysctls, netem present) is still owed.
